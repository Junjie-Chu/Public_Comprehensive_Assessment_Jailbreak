## Unified Usage Policy

We first collect the usage policies from five major LLM-related service providers (Google, OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft).
Many policies tend to provide a general description by synthesizing many specific categories within an overarching category.
Unlike the general ones, we summarize our unified policy by *explicit coverage* to find a clear common feature within the same category.

### ***Violation Category Details:***
